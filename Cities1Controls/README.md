## Cities1Controls Mod

This mod adds a new control scheme to Cities: Skylines II. It is based on the control scheme of Cities 1.
For now this mod is in an early stage and only adds the `HOME` key to reset the elevation to ground level.
More features will be added in the future.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

### Controls
